# Conway's Game of Life
John Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton and is played on an infinite 2D grid of cells. Each cell can be either alive or dead. The status of each cell changes each on turn of the game depending on the statuses of the cell's neighbours. This can lead to very interesting patterns.
